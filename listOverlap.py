# Take two lists, say for example these two:
# a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
# and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that
# are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program
# works on two lists of different sizes.

# Extras:
# Randomly generate two lists to test this

l1 = [1, 3, 4, 5, 9]
l2 = [2, 1, 3, 7, 9, 2, 3]

print(zip(l1, l2))
